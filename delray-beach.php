            <p class="section-description">From beachfront condos to historic bungalows, quartz countertops are the ideal choice for Delray Beach's coastal lifestyle and tropical climate.</p>

                    <p>Living the Delray Beach lifestyle means sand, salt air, and humidity. Quartz is <strong>non-porous and won't absorb moisture</strong>—perfect for coastal living. No sealing required, ever.</p>

                        <p><strong>Quartz is ideal for Delray Beach's coastal environment.</strong> Its non-porous surface won't absorb humidity, salt air, or moisture. Unlike granite or marble, quartz requires no sealing and resists the effects of Florida's subtropical climate.
