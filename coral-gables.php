            <h2 class="section-title">Why Coral Gables' Finest Homes Choose Quartz</h2>
            <p class="section-description">Coral Gables homeowners demand surfaces that honor their homes' architectural legacy while providing modern performance. Here's why quartz is the premier choice for The City Beautiful:</p>

            <div class="features-grid">
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <i class="bi bi-columns-gap"></i>
                    <h3>Mediterranean-Perfect Aesthetics</h3>
                    <p>Quartz offers the <strong>timeless look of Italian marble</strong> preferred in Mediterranean design—warm veining, elegant movement—without natural stone's maintenance demands. Perfect for Coral Gables' architectural vision.</p>

                    <h3>Florida Climate Resistant</h3>
                    <p>Unlike natural marble that etches and stains, quartz is <strong>non-porous and humidity-proof</strong>—essential for South Florida's tropical climate. No sealing required, ever.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <i class="bi bi-award"></i>
                    <h3>Timeless Durability</h3>
                    <p>Coral Gables homes are built to last generations. Quartz countertops provide <strong>decades of beauty</strong> with superior scratch, stain, and heat resistance—worthy of your estate's legacy.</p>
                </div>

                        <p>For Coral Gables' Mediterranean homes, we recommend <strong>warm-toned quartz with subtle veining</strong> reminiscent of Italian marble, creamy whites like Calacatta, soft beiges, and earth-toned selections. Brands like <strong>Cambria, Caesarstone, and Silestone</strong> offer collections specifically designed to complement classical architecture. Our design consultants specialize in matching quartz to your home's specific architectural period and style.</p>

                        <p>Yes! Modern quartz beautifully <strong>replicates the marble and limestone</strong> traditionally used in historic Mediterranean homes—without the maintenance challenges. Many Coral Gables homeowners choose quartz because it provides the <strong>timeless aesthetic</strong> their historic homes demand while offering superior durability and easier care. The key is selecting the right color and veining pattern, which our experts specialize in.</p>
