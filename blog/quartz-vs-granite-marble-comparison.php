                <p>Choosing between <strong>quartz vs granite</strong> for your kitchen or bathroom countertops is one of the most important decisions you'll make during a renovation. With South Florida homeowners investing $3,000 to $15,000 in new countertops, understanding the difference between quartz and granite can save you money and ensure your surfaces look stunning for decades.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Each Countertop Material</h2>

                <h3>What is Quartz?</h3>
                <p>Quartz countertops are engineered stone surfaces made from approximately 90-95% ground natural quartz crystals combined with polymer resins. This creates a non-porous, consistent surface with exceptional durability. Leading <a href="../quartz-brands">quartz brands</a> like Cambria, Silestone, and Caesarstone produce stunning surfaces that mimic natural stone.</p>

                <h3>What is Granite?</h3>
                <p>Granite is 100% natural igneous rock formed from cooled magma. Each slab features unique patterns, but granite is porous and requires regular sealing to prevent staining.</p>

                <h3>What is Marble?</h3>
                <p>Marble is a metamorphic rock prized for elegant veining. When comparing <strong>quartz vs marble countertops</strong>, marble offers classic beauty but demands significantly more maintenance due to its softness and porosity.</p>

                <h3>What is Quartzite?</h3>
                <p>Understanding the <strong>difference between quartz and quartzite</strong> prevents costly mistakes. Unlike engineered quartz, quartzite is natural metamorphic rock with marble-like aesthetics but shares granite's porosity issues.</p>

                <h2>Durability Comparison: Is Quartz Better Than Granite?</h2>

                <h3>Scratch Resistance</h3>
                <p>Quartz ranks 7 on the Mohs hardness scale, making it highly scratch-resistant. Granite scores similarly at 6-7, while marble's softness (3-5) makes it vulnerable.</p>

                <h3>Stain Resistance</h3>
                <p>One of the primary <strong>advantages of quartz countertops</strong> is their non-porous surface. Spilled wine, coffee, or tomato sauce cannot penetrate. Granite requires sealing to achieve similar protection.</p>

                <h3>Heat Resistance</h3>
                <p>Granite holds an advantage here—it withstands hot pans directly. Quartz's resin content makes it sensitive to extreme heat, so use trivets.</p>

                <h2>Quartz Countertops Pros and Cons</h2>

                <h3>Quartz Maintenance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Daily cleaning:</strong> Warm water and mild soap</li>
                    <li><strong>Sealing required:</strong> Never</li>
                    <li><strong>Special products:</strong> None needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual maintenance cost:</strong> $0</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Granite Maintenance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Daily cleaning:</strong> pH-neutral stone cleaner</li>
                    <li><strong>Sealing required:</strong> Every 1-2 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual maintenance cost:</strong> $50-150</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Quartz vs Granite Cost: Complete Breakdown</h2>

                <p>Many homeowners wonder: <strong>is quartz cheaper than granite?</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quartz:</strong> $50-150 per square foot installed</li>
                    <li><strong>Granite:</strong> $40-200 per square foot installed</li>
                    <li><strong>Marble:</strong> $75-250 per square foot installed</li>
                    <li><strong>Quartzite:</strong> $70-200 per square foot installed</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When comparing <strong>quartz vs granite cost</strong>, mid-range options are similarly priced. However, when factoring in lifetime maintenance costs, quartz often proves more economical over 15-20 years.</p>

                <h2>Why Quartz is Ideal for South Florida's Climate</h2>

                <p>Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Boca Raton experience 75-90% humidity levels. This constant moisture can:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Accelerate mold growth in porous materials</li>
                    <li>Cause granite and marble sealants to break down faster</li>
                    <li>Create water absorption issues near sinks</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Quartz's non-porous surface eliminates these concerns. Water beads on the surface rather than absorbing.</p>

                <h2>Complete Comparison at a Glance</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quartz:</strong> Non-porous, never needs sealing, excellent stain resistance, $50-150/sq ft</li>
                    <li><strong>Granite:</strong> Porous (needs sealing every 1-2 years), good stain resistance when sealed, $40-200/sq ft</li>
                    <li><strong>Marble:</strong> Highly porous (needs sealing every 6-12 months), poor stain resistance, $75-250/sq ft</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2>

                <h3>Choose Quartz If You Want:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Zero-maintenance surfaces</li>
                    <li>Maximum protection against stains and moisture</li>
                    <li>Consistent patterns that match your design vision</li>
                    <li>Optimal performance in South Florida's humid climate</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Choose Granite If You Want:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>100% natural material with unique patterns</li>
                    <li>Superior heat resistance for placing hot pans directly</li>
                    <li>Potentially lower upfront costs</li>
                </ul>
