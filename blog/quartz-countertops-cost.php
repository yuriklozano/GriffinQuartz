                </ul>

                <h2>Factors That Affect Quartz Countertop Cost</h2>
                <p>Several factors influence the final price of your quartz countertop project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Brand:</strong> Premium brands like Cambria cost more than budget options</li>

                    <li><strong>Edge profile:</strong> Simple edges cost less than elaborate profiles</li>
                    <li><strong>Square footage:</strong> Larger projects may qualify for volume discounts</li>
                    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Cutouts for sinks and cooktops add to the cost</li>
